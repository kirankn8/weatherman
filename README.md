# WeatherMan

WeatherMan aims to provide intelligent weather forecasts for geeks so that you don't miss the outside world while being deeply engrossed in coding on your favorite editor. You can now get hourly, daily and weekly forecasts right on your Visual Studio Code.
Just install the extension and click on the WeatherMan icon status bar. Yes! It is as simple as that.

P.S: You can also quickly check weather with `ctrl + w` shortcut.
