WeatherMan aims to provide intelligent weather forecasts so that you don't miss the outside world while being deeply engrossed in hacking on your favorite editor. You can now get hourly, daily and weekly forecasts right on your Visual Studio Code.

Just install the extension and click on the WeatherMan icon in status bar. Yes! It is as simple as that.

Cheers! :snowman:

P.S: You can also quickly check weather with `ctrl + w` shortcut.
